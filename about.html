## About

Ashley Reardon is a Human Factors Engineer Intern at Quantum Improvements Consulting, where she applies her background in psychology, modeling and simulation, and instructional design to understand and improve human performance. Her current research focuses on applying user-centered design and mobile application best practices to the development of an adaptable mobile application for financial literacy training. She has over 4 years of diverse research experience, ranging from predicting trust in human-robot interactions to predicting illicit search activities through eye-tracking technology. She holds a B.S. in Psychology, and is a M.S. candidate for Modeling and Simulation at the University of Central Florida. She is also a candidate for the Graduate Certificate in Instructional Design for Simulations. Outside of the research realm, you can find Ashley emerged in the immersive world of gaming, dedicating thousands of hours to RPGs, MOBAs, and competitive card games.
