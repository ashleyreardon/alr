# Project Introduction 
As part of a large-scale effort to improve financial literacy for Service members, a mobile application was developed to serve as a financial support tool throughout the various milestones and life events of Service members’ careers.

# My Role
I joined the design team at Quantum Improvements Consulting (QIC) near the beginning of development. I worked as a Human Factors Engineer intern on this project from May 2017 until its completion in September 2018. During this time, I created content for 6 financial components, designed wireframes, mockups, and node maps, assisted with two rounds of usability testing, and conducted quality assurance testing. On top of supporting the development of a user-friendly mobile application, I also published and presented a <a href="http://www.modsimworld.org/papers/2018/MODSIM_2018_Paper_not_required_for_a_23.pdf">professional paper</a> on the mobile application design process and provided significant contributions to written reports that were disseminated to the development team and stakeholders.

# The Challenge: Managing scope and transforming dull information into engaging information
When designing a support tool for Service members during their entire career, we had to consider everything from entering the service to leaving the service. The breadth and depth of this scope became increasingly complex, especially when trying to design an engaging tool in a limited mobile interface.

**The Solution**: Making an all-encompassing financial tool that is informative and engaging required a strategy grounded in **empathy**, **understanding**, and **adaptability**. To ensure user needs were being met, we adopted a user-centered approach within an Agile environment. Our goal was to make informed decisions based on user feedback and user needs by placing the user at the center of the design process. By communicating early and often with the customers, we were able to gain access to end-users for usability and effectiveness testing, which drove the feedback needed for constant iterations.

Financial content is not the most glamorous or easy to understand topic—oftentimes people seek out financial help after a problem has already occurred, meaning their experience with financial content comes from a point of stress and frustration. Our challenge was figuring out how to transform previous dull information into understandable and engaging information, so users could become proactive instead of reactive regarding their financial goals and pain points.

**The Solution**: Micro-learning strategies were implemented with the goal of transforming financial content from dense and heavy text to easily digestible bite-sized pieces. Micro-learning has shown to be effective in reducing cognitive load on users, providing learning units that support on-the-go learning, and facilitating granular learning objectives. Gamification and adaptable elements were also applied to provide engagement, absorption, retention, and greater interaction between the user and the tool.

# Understanding the users

One of the most important steps in creating a memorable user experience is understanding the end-users. This can be accomplished by creating user profiles and user stories which describe the goals, needs, and interests of the primary types of users who will engage with and recommend the product. Throughout the design process the perspective of the end-user was adopted to facilitate understanding of the primary users and to help understand what the primary functions of the system should be. 

Understanding who will be using the end-system teaches empathy, which is critical for designing a positive user experience. This empathy helps us understand the motivations for using the support tool and help understand and mitigate existing or potential user frustrations. Through interviews with SMEs and research, three primary user types were identified, serving as a reference point throughout the entire design lifecycle.

#Creating Content
For this project, I was responsible for 6 content sections: Vehicle Purchasing, Compound Interest, Investments, Marriage, Credit, and Leave and Earnings Statement (LES). 

![Content Sections.png](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v0kbxkhiip0qc5z/Content%20Sections.png?dl=0&raw=1)

For these sections I sourced content, applied microlearning strategies to re-engineer sourced content, created wireframes, node maps, mockups, established learning objectives, and created assessment questions. Since we were working within an Agile environment, I worked closely with the design team, software developers, and SMEs to incorporate feedback and provide continual design iterations.

After establishing what content was needed and where that content would be housed, I began to source and re-engineer my assigned content sections. Using a top-down approach I first conducted research on each financial topic, then applied micro-learning principles to transform the content into bite-sized pieces for easier comprehension on the mobile interface. 

*For the purpose of this portfolio I will be focusing on describing the major developments of the Compound Interest section.*

# Wireframes

After the content was reviewed with our SME and the design team, I brainstormed ways in which the content could be implemented to meet the end-user’s goals. One of the primary goals was to make complex financial content engaging and easy to find, therefore it was important I organized my content in a way that was intuitive and minimized the number of clicks needed to access content so users could access information on-the-go and during a point-of-need. With these goals in mind I began to generate ideas about user flow, user interactions, UI arrangement, and motivational and engagement elements. Through rough sketches and simplistic wireframes, I started to transform my ideas into a tangible product. 

With Compound Interest, three main sections emerged; 1.) What is Compound Interest? 2.) Compound vs. Simple Interest and 3.) Compound Interest Calculator. Breaking the content down into these categories transferred agency to the user by allowing them to make the decision on whether or not they wanted broad information (tailored to users with little to no financial background—ex. Sara Rickten), more detailed information, or tools & resources (tailored to users with some financial background who are looking for resources during a point-of-need—ex. Frank Walters). Learning objectives were presented prior to entry into each sub-section to provide content transparency and enable targeted thinking throughout content learning/engagement. Finally, assessment questions were created for each sub-section to facilitate user-learning and to provide assistance and feedback if/when users failed to meet learning objectives. These assessments also serve as an engagement strategy to promote recall and facilitate transfer of recently learned material.

# Mockups

After reviewing the wireframes with the design team and incorporating their feedback, I began to add graphical elements that would communicate what the content would look like in the actual application. The biggest feedback involved the Compound vs. Simple Interest sub-section. To promote engagement and to explicitly communicate the difference between the two concepts, it was important to create an interactive element where users could compare these concepts by using their own data. This interaction echoes the compound and simple interest calculators that end-users may access during a time-of-need. Providing all of the financial information that end-users would need in one place would help overall usability, making finding financial answers less tedious and time-consuming. 

To incorporate the design teams’ feedback, I utilized the concept of a ‘money-tree’ as a metaphor to reimagine dull or difficult information in a familiar and less-daunting way. With this new concept, users could input their own investment and interest rate and compare their potential earnings using compound or simple interest. This implementation was designed to be intuitive and minimize the amount of out-of-app content users would have to access in order to answer their financial questions. 

Within the mockups, I included information that described the optimal user path and interaction notes to explain the system requirements and user expectations. These notes allowed for smooth communication between the design team and the software development team. Once reviewed by the design team, the mockups were sent to the instructional designer for implementation into the authoring tool, Adapt, that was used for content implementation and revision. By using Adapt, we were able to make content related changes fast and efficiently by avoiding the disruption of the software code that the engineers were simultaneously working on.

# Implementation 

Several changes were made under the direction of our instructional designer to better adapt the mockups into a format that was optimized for mobile devices while being user-friendly and intuitive. The major change that preceded implementation was the removal of the input boxes from the text block and the creation of a separate block that easily distinguished the content from the interactive elements. By adding a colored box behind the input boxes, a signal was created that clearly indicated that users could interact with the element. Question buttons were also added that when selected, explicit instructions for using the interaction would appear as an overlay. This feature is important for end users that are less technology proficient as it provides additional help without adding unnecessary content/interactions for more technology proficient end users. Finally, the interaction behind the ‘money tree’ was modified to mimic existing mobile standards by including a more user-friendly and accessible scroll bar and removing the up and down swipe interaction.

*The final product was not designed by the author, rather the final implementation was created by a contracted instructional designer. *

# User Testing

During the next phase of development, user feedback was extracted for Compound Interest during a summative testing for usability and effectiveness. While all 6 participants found the interactions to meet their expectations and found the section to be intuitive and easy to use, several participants wanted a clearer link between the input box and the ‘money tree’ graphic. Since both elements are separated by text and cannot fit comfortably together on the same screen, future design efforts must consider alternative designs to create an intuitive link between the two elements. This can be easily accomplished by replacing the ‘money tree’ graphic with a more discreet and smaller bar graph, and by repositioning the text above the interaction. 

While summative testing yielded a lot of recommendations for improvement, the overall impressions were very positive. Participants found that the application was easy to navigate, the content was useful and informative, the interactions were “smooth” and responsive, and the buttons were clear and easy to interact with. 

# Reflection

My favorite part of the design process was developing the mockups because of the heavy focus on design. However, to create a positive and memorable user experience a product can’t sustain on aesthetics alone; it must also be functionable. For future efforts I will focus more on functionality by asking myself *“what function does this serve?”* to help me refrain from adding unnecessary elements that might detract from the major goals.
