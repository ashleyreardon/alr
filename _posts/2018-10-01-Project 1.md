# Project Introduction 
As part of a large-scale effort to improve financial literacy for Service members, a mobile application was developed to serve as a financial support tool throughout the various milestones and life events of Service members’ careers.

# My Role
I joined the design team at Quantum Improvements Consulting (QIC) near the beginning of development. I worked as a Human Factors Engineer intern on this project from May 2017 until its completion in September 2018. During this time, I created content for 6 financial components, designed wireframes, mockups, and node maps, assisted with two rounds of usability testing, and conducted quality assurance testing. On top of supporting the development of a user-friendly mobile application, I also published and presented a <a href="http://www.modsimworld.org/papers/2018/MODSIM_2018_Paper_not_required_for_a_23.pdf">professional paper</a> on the mobile application design process and provided significant contributions to written reports that were disseminated to the development team and stakeholders.

# The Challenge: Managing scope and transforming dull information into engaging information
When designing a support tool for Service members during their entire career, we had to consider everything from entering the service to leaving the service. The breadth and depth of this scope became increasingly complex, especially when trying to design an engaging tool in a limited mobile interface.

**The Solution**: Making an all-encompassing financial tool that is informative and engaging required a strategy grounded in **empathy**, **understanding**, and **adaptability**. To ensure user needs were being met, we adopted a user-centered approach within an Agile environment. Our goal was to make informed decisions based on user feedback and user needs by placing the user at the center of the design process. By communicating early and often with the customers, we were able to gain access to end-users for usability and effectiveness testing, which drove the feedback needed for constant iterations.

Financial content is not the most glamorous or easy to understand topic—oftentimes people seek out financial help after a problem has already occurred, meaning their experience with financial content comes from a point of stress and frustration. Our challenge was figuring out how to transform previous dull information into understandable and engaging information, so users could become proactive instead of reactive regarding their financial goals and pain points.

**The Solution**: Micro-learning strategies were implemented with the goal of transforming financial content from dense and heavy text to easily digestible bite-sized pieces. Micro-learning has shown to be effective in reducing cognitive load on users, providing learning units that support on-the-go learning, and facilitating granular learning objectives. Gamification and adaptable elements were also applied to provide engagement, absorption, retention, and greater interaction between the user and the tool.

# Understanding the users

One of the most important steps in creating a memorable user experience is understanding the end-users. This can be accomplished by creating user profiles and user stories which describe the goals, needs, and interests of the primary types of users who will engage with and recommend the product. Throughout the design process the perspective of the end-user was adopted to facilitate understanding of the primary users and to help understand what the primary functions of the system should be. 

Understanding who will be using the end-system teaches empathy, which is critical for designing a positive user experience. This empathy helps us understand the motivations for using the support tool and help understand and mitigate existing or potential user frustrations. Through interviews with SMEs and research, three primary user types were identified, serving as a reference point throughout the entire design lifecycle.

For this project, I was responsible for 6 content sections: Vehicle Purchasing, Compound Interest, Investments, Marriage, Credit, and Leave and Earnings Statement (LES).
