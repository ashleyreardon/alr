# Project Introduction 
As part of a large-scale effort to improve financial literacy for Service members, a mobile application was developed to serve as a financial support tool throughout the various milestones and life events of Service members’ careers.

# My Role
I joined the design team at Quantum Improvements Consulting (QIC) near the beginning of development. I worked as a Human Factors Engineer intern on this project from May 2017 until its completion in September 2018. During this time, I created content for 6 financial components, designed wireframes, mockups, and node maps, assisted with two rounds of usability testing, and conducted quality assurance testing. On top of supporting the development of a user-friendly mobile application, I also published and presented a <a href="http://www.modsimworld.org/papers/2018/MODSIM_2018_Paper_not_required_for_a_23.pdf">professional paper</a> on the mobile application design process and provided significant contributions to written reports that were disseminated to the development team and stakeholders.

# The Challenge: Managing scope and transforming dull information into engaging information
When designing a support tool for Service members during their entire career, we had to consider everything from entering the service to leaving the service. The breadth and depth of this scope became increasingly complex, especially when trying to design an engaging tool in a limited mobile interface.

**The Solution**: Making an all-encompassing financial tool that is informative and engaging required a strategy grounded in **empathy**, **understanding**, and **adaptability**. To ensure user needs were being met, we adopted a user-centered approach within an Agile environment. Our goal was to make informed decisions based on user feedback and user needs by placing the user at the center of the design process. By communicating early and often with the customers, we were able to gain access to end-users for usability and effectiveness testing, which drove the feedback needed for constant iterations.

Financial content is not the most glamorous or easy to understand topic—oftentimes people seek out financial help after a problem has already occurred, meaning their experience with financial content comes from a point of stress and frustration. Our challenge was figuring out how to transform previous dull information into understandable and engaging information, so users could become proactive instead of reactive regarding their financial goals and pain points.
