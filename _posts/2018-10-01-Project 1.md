# My Role
I joined the design team at Quantum Improvements Consulting (QIC) near the beginning of development. I worked as a Human Factors Engineer intern on this project from May 2017 until its completion in September 2018. During this time, I created content for 6 financial components, designed wireframes, mockups, and node maps, assisted with two rounds of usability testing, and conducted quality assurance testing. On top of supporting the development of a user-friendly mobile application, I also published and presented a professional paper <a href="http://www.modsimworld.org/papers/2018/MODSIM_2018_Paper_not_required_for_a_23.pdf/">professional paper</a> on the mobile application design process and provided significant contributions to written reports that were disseminated to the development team and stakeholders.
