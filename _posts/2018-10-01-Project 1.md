# Project Introduction 
As part of a large-scale effort to improve financial literacy for Service members, a mobile application was developed to serve as a financial support tool throughout the various milestones and life events of Service members’ careers.

# My Role
I joined the design team at Quantum Improvements Consulting (QIC) near the beginning of development. I worked as a Human Factors Engineer intern on this project from May 2017 until its completion in September 2018. During this time, I created content for 6 financial components, designed wireframes, mockups, and node maps, assisted with two rounds of usability testing, and conducted quality assurance testing. On top of supporting the development of a user-friendly mobile application, I also published and presented a <a href="http://www.modsimworld.org/papers/2018/MODSIM_2018_Paper_not_required_for_a_23.pdf">professional paper</a> on the mobile application design process and provided significant contributions to written reports that were disseminated to the development team and stakeholders.

# The Challenge: Managing scope and transforming dull information into engaging information
When designing a support tool for Service members during their entire career, we had to consider everything from entering the service to leaving the service. The breadth and depth of this scope became increasingly complex, especially when trying to design an engaging tool in a limited mobile interface.

**The Solution**: Making an all-encompassing financial tool that is informative and engaging required a strategy grounded in **empathy**, **understanding**, and **adaptability**. To ensure user needs were being met, we adopted a user-centered approach within an Agile environment. Our goal was to make informed decisions based on user feedback and user needs by placing the user at the center of the design process. By communicating early and often with the customers, we were able to gain access to end-users for usability and effectiveness testing, which drove the feedback needed for constant iterations.

Financial content is not the most glamorous or easy to understand topic—oftentimes people seek out financial help after a problem has already occurred, meaning their experience with financial content comes from a point of stress and frustration. Our challenge was figuring out how to transform previous dull information into understandable and engaging information, so users could become proactive instead of reactive regarding their financial goals and pain points.

**The Solution**: Micro-learning strategies were implemented with the goal of transforming financial content from dense and heavy text to easily digestible bite-sized pieces. Micro-learning has shown to be effective in reducing cognitive load on users, providing learning units that support on-the-go learning, and facilitating granular learning objectives. Gamification and adaptable elements were also applied to provide engagement, absorption, retention, and greater interaction between the user and the tool.

# Understanding the users

One of the most important steps in creating a memorable user experience is understanding the end-users. This can be accomplished by creating user profiles and user stories which describe the goals, needs, and interests of the primary types of users who will engage with and recommend the product. Throughout the design process the perspective of the end-user was adopted to facilitate understanding of the primary users and to help understand what the primary functions of the system should be. 

Understanding who will be using the end-system teaches empathy, which is critical for designing a positive user experience. This empathy helps us understand the motivations for using the support tool and help understand and mitigate existing or potential user frustrations. Through interviews with SMEs and research, three primary user types were identified, serving as a reference point throughout the entire design lifecycle.

#Creating Content
For this project, I was responsible for 6 content sections: Vehicle Purchasing, Compound Interest, Investments, Marriage, Credit, and Leave and Earnings Statement (LES). 

![Content Sections.png](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v0kbxkhiip0qc5z/Content%20Sections.png?dl=0&raw=1)

For these sections I sourced content, applied microlearning strategies to re-engineer sourced content, created wireframes, node maps, mockups, established learning objectives, and created assessment questions. Since we were working within an Agile environment, I worked closely with the design team, software developers, and SMEs to incorporate feedback and provide continual design iterations.

After establishing what content was needed and where that content would be housed, I began to source and re-engineer my assigned content sections. Using a top-down approach I first conducted research on each financial topic, then applied micro-learning principles to transform the content into bite-sized pieces for easier comprehension on the mobile interface. 

*For the purpose of this portfolio I will be focusing on describing the major developments of the Compound Interest section.*

# Wireframes

After the content was reviewed with our SME and the design team, I brainstormed ways in which the content could be implemented to meet the end-user’s goals. One of the primary goals was to make complex financial content engaging and easy to find, therefore it was important I organized my content in a way that was intuitive and minimized the number of clicks needed to access content so users could access information on-the-go and during a point-of-need. With these goals in mind I began to generate ideas about user flow, user interactions, UI arrangement, and motivational and engagement elements. Through rough sketches and simplistic wireframes, I started to transform my ideas into a tangible product. 

With Compound Interest, three main sections emerged; 1.) What is Compound Interest? 2.) Compound vs. Simple Interest and 3.) Compound Interest Calculator. Breaking the content down into these categories transferred agency to the user by allowing them to make the decision on whether or not they wanted broad information (tailored to users with little to no financial background—ex. Sara Rickten), more detailed information, or tools & resources (tailored to users with some financial background who are looking for resources during a point-of-need—ex. Frank Walters). Learning objectives were presented prior to entry into each sub-section to provide content transparency and enable targeted thinking throughout content learning/engagement. Finally, assessment questions were created for each sub-section to facilitate user-learning and to provide assistance and feedback if/when users failed to meet learning objectives. These assessments also serve as an engagement strategy to promote recall and facilitate transfer of recently learned material.
